# Range Master: Proposed Game Stack

I propose using Phaser as the core framework for building "Range Master," a simple yet robust stack for your web-based arcade golf game. Below, I'll outline the stack and explain why it's the best choice for your project, especially since you're coding with AI assistance and targeting a playable web experience.

## Proposed Stack

### Frontend
* HTML5, CSS, JavaScript: The foundational technologies for any web-based game, providing structure, styling, and interactivity.
* Phaser: An open-source 2D game framework built on HTML5, designed specifically for browser games. It simplifies game development by handling the game loop, rendering, input, and more.

### Assets
* 2D Graphics: Simple sprites for the driving range, golf ball, targets (e.g., bullseyes, balloons), and swing meter. Use free online assets or create minimal placeholders to start.

### Deployment
* Static Web Hosting: Host the game on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, as it runs entirely client-side with no initial server requirements.

## Why This Stack is Simple Yet Robust

### 1. Phaser Simplifies Game Development
Phaser is perfect for "Range Master" because it provides all the tools you need out of the box:
* **3-Click Swing Meter**: Phaser's input system easily captures mouse or touch events. You can use its graphics tools to draw a moving meter and JavaScript to calculate power and accuracy based on click timing.
* **Game Logic**: The core loop (hit balls, score points) is managed by Phaser's scene system, which organizes the start screen, gameplay, and HUD.
* **Ball Trajectory**: For your arcade-style physics, Phaser's Arcade Physics can simulate the ball's flight and detect collisions with targets. Alternatively, you can use basic math for a simple parabola if you prefer lighter logic.
* **Target Management**: Phaser's sprite groups make it easy to spawn random targets and award bonus points on collision.

### 2. Minimal Setup
You only need a basic web setup:
* An index.html file to load the game.
* A CSS file for basic styling.
* JavaScript files with Phaser to handle everything else. This simplicity lets you focus on gameplay rather than infrastructure, which is ideal when coding with AI.

### 3. Cross-Platform Playability
Phaser ensures "Range Master" works across modern browsers and devices (desktop, tablets, phones), meeting your web-based requirement. Its built-in optimization handles performance well for a lightweight game like this.

### 4. AI-Friendly
Phaser has a large community, extensive documentation, and countless tutorials. This wealth of resources means AI tools can provide accurate code suggestions and troubleshoot effectively, speeding up your development process.

### 5. Room for Growth
While simple, this stack is robust enough to support your progression ideas:
* **Levels**: Create multiple Phaser scenes with different range layouts or target configurations.
* **Challenges**: Add timed events by tweaking game logic or introducing moving targets with Phaser's animation tools.
* **Unlockables**: Implement a shop system using local storage to track points and unlock cosmetics (e.g., new ball sprites).

### 6. No Backend Hassle (Initially)
Starting with local storage keeps the stack lean. You can add Firebase later for leaderboards without overhauling the codebase, making it a scalable choice.

## How It Matches Your Design Document

### Gameplay Mechanics
* **Swing Meter**: Phaser's event handling and graphics make the 3-click system straightforward to implement.
* **Scoring**: Distance points can be calculated from the ball's landing position, and target hits can trigger bonus effects using Phaser's collision detection.
* **Controls**: Aiming adjustments can be coded with keyboard or mouse input, fully supported by Phaser.

### Game World
* **Driving Range**: A static background sprite with overlaid target sprites creates your environment.
* **Visuals**: Phaser supports cartoonish sprites, aligning with your arcade vibe.

### User Interface
* **HUD**: Phaser's text and image objects display the score and balls remaining, updated dynamically.
* **Menus**: Scenes handle the start screen and options effortlessly.

### Art and Progression
* **Assets**: Start with free 2D graphics from sources like OpenGameArt, swapping them later if needed.
* **Challenges and Unlockables**: Phaser's flexibility supports these as future enhancements.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Create an HTML file, include the Phaser library (via CDN or download), and link your JS file.
2. **Core Loop**: Use a Phaser scene to initialize the range, spawn targets, and handle the swing meter.
3. **Test**: Run it locally in a browser, then deploy to a static host like Netlify.

## Conclusion

This stack—centered on Phaser with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript—is the simplest yet most robust choice for "Range Master." It delivers your core gameplay with minimal setup, leverages AI-friendly tools, and provides a solid foundation for future features. You'll have a playable web game quickly, with the flexibility to expand as your vision grows.
