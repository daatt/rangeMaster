## Game Overview

- **Title**: Range Master 
- **Genre**: Arcade, Sports
- **Platform**: Web
- **Target Audience**: Casual gamers, golf enthusiasts seeking a fun, non-realistic experience
- **Summary**: A simple, arcade-style golf game set at a driving range where players hit balls to score points by distance and by striking random targets. Featuring a 3-click swing meter, the game delivers a fun and engaging skill challenge focused on controlling power and accuracy.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Core Loop**: Players hit golf balls at a driving range using a 3-click swing meter, earning points based on how far the ball travels and by hitting random objects scattered across the range.
- **Swing Meter**:
   - **First Click**: Starts the meter moving.
   - **Second Click**: Sets the power level (determines distance).
   - **Third Click**: Sets the accuracy (affects direction).
   - Missing the optimal timing on either click results in a less effective shot (e.g., reduced distance or veering off course).
- **Scoring**:
   - **Distance**: Earn points proportional to how far the ball travels (e.g., 1 point per yard).
   - **Targets**: Random objects (e.g., signs, bullseyes) appear on the range; hitting them awards bonus points.
- **Controls**:
   - Aiming: Simple left/right adjustments to set the shot direction.
   - Swing: Executed via the 3-click meter.
